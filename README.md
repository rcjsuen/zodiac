# Zodiac

Zodiac was designed to be a collection of simple games for learning a foreign language when your first language is English. However, it could be modified to adapt to any two different languages with a small bit of work.

## Running Zodiac

1. Clone this repository.
2. Use `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Start the server with `npm run server`.
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/flashcard.html` in the browser.

## Configuring Zodiac

If you want to create your own word lists, simply create your own file with the English word on the first line and the translation on the next line constantly alternating between the two languages.

```
EnglishWord1
ForeignLanguageWord1
EnglishWord2
ForeignLanguageWord2
...
```

Now you can use the file as your own custom word list for studying.
