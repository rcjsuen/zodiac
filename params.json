{"name":"Zodiac","tagline":"Zodiac is an application backed by HTML5 and JavaScript for studying English.","body":"### About\r\nZodiac was born when I realized just how hard it was for some of my students to spell out English words. Flashcards are portable but they cannot be easily shared. Zodiac provides a way for people to easily create and share flashcards due to the simple format of the input files.\r\n\r\n### Support and Contact\r\nIf you have any feedback, suggestions, or bugs to report about Zodiac, please contact @rcjsuen or visit [Zodiac's GitHub page](https://github.com/rcjsuen/zodiac).\r\n","google":"UA-57159875-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
